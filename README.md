**Background:**
In 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established in response to the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 and Great Recession. The CFPB is an independent federal agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It has handled over 1 million complaints, helping consumers connect with financial companies to get direct responses about problems with mortgages, student loans, payday loans, debt collection, credit reports, and other financial products and services. https://www.consumerfinance.gov. 

**Project Objective:** Predict the type of resolution offered for a consumer finance complaint related to credit cards, particularly whether the complaint is closed with monetary relief, using the CFPB 2012-2017 data.
